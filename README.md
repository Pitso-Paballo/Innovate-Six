# Innovate-Six


## About Us
Our company is a team of five passionate individuals from different parts of the country, united by a shared commitment to improve early childhood literacy. Growing up, most of us came from families with limited incomes, where access to specialized English and Math classes or tutors was out of reach. This experience highlighted for us the critical importance of early language and math development and the unfortunate reality that quality education is often inaccessible due to financial limitations.

## Our Mission
We believe that every child, regardless of background, should have the opportunity to develop strong reading, pronunciation, and numeracy skills from an early age. This conviction inspired us to create an AI-powered tool that offers individualized reading support. Our tool is designed to help young children read aloud, accurately pronounce words, and build confidence in their abilities.

## Why AI?
AI technology allows us to create a scalable and adaptable solution. It enables us to reach countless children without the need for costly infrastructure, making it possible to keep our tool free and widely accessible. Through this approach, we aim to break down the barriers that prevent many families from accessing quality early educational resources.

## Our Vision
We envision a future where every child, regardless of their family's financial situation, has access to the resources they need to develop foundational language and math skills. Our AI-powered tool is just the beginning, as we work to empower toddlers from all walks of life with the confidence and skills they need to succeed.

## How It Works
Our free, easy-to-use plugin is designed for young learners, helping them with:
- **Reading Support**: Encourages children to read aloud and practice their pronunciation.
- **Pronunciation Guidance**: Provides individualized feedback to help with proper word pronunciation.
- **Early Numeracy Skills**: Supports early development of math skills through interactive, AI-driven activities.

Together, weâ€™re working to make early literacy accessible to all. Thank you for supporting our mission!
